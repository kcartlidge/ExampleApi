## Creating the API

This is a standard out of the box API which is then iterated over with further commits. [You can view those commits here](https://github.com/kcartlidge/ExampleApi/commits/main). To get to the initial starting point yourself in a new API, these are the choices I made:

Choosing a project type:

Please note that this repo includes a `.editorconfig` file. Visual Studio will happily use it, but you should *not* edit it with its GUI editor. Doing so will likely add a large number of Microsoft-specific extra settings.
